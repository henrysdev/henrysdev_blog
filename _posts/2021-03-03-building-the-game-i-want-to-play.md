### A New Hobby

Around the start of the pandemic I discovered that there are few things that bring me more joy than playing and creating music on my electric piano. I was reunited with this instrument after a long hiatus and I’ve had a wonderful time getting back into it.

Skill-wise I am somewhere around low-intermediate, knowing enough to read music and annoy roommates with the same ten songs. I enjoy playing keyboard immensely as a hobby and I find it very rewarding as I continue to improve.

### The Idea Graveyard

Around the same time I rediscovered electric piano, I also started to recognize a very persistent and all-too-common thought pattern of mine; **I have an idea for a new piece of software that I deeply want to exist, but I don’t pursue building it because of lack of time + XYZ**. Let me know if any of these sound familiar to you

> “Someone else has already created something that’s vaguely similar”

> “Nobody will use it except for me”

> “The project is too big for just one person”

> “It’s difficult to monetize and therefore it’s a pointless endeavour”

This is where my brain typically fought itself. I’d come up with a few of these reasons and shut down my idea. Sometimes my idea would even turn into a bit of code before my brain shut it down, ultimately putting the project to rest among a slew of other abandoned github repositories.

### Novel Inspiration

It was about six months ago when I first got the inspiration for Midi Matches. I can recall a specific time when I was participating in a favorite activity of mine; turning on an old funk song and playing my own keyboard over it, making it up as I go.

I was having such a great time jamming out by myself while sheltered in place that I had a very memorable thought; **Improvisational keyboard is such a blast. I want to have a shared experience with others around this activity that does not require being in the same physical space**.

I got a warm and tingly feeling realizing that I can build such an experience myself, and I can build it with software! This kicked off a long brainstorm session of how to implement such a project through the most compelling, accessible, and approachable software medium possible.

After a good bit of thought and research, I concluded that my best bet for creating the experience I desired would be a web browser-based online multiplayer game where players can plug their MIDI keyboards into their computers and play scored games with each other in realtime. Thus, Midi Matches was born.

### So Far So Good!

While there is plenty of work left on this project, I have made significant progress six months in and I am still feeling compelled to work on it. I believe the key difference this time around is that I am building **a software project in a domain that I’m passionate about that I can't wait to use myself**.

Since working on a project that inspires me in this way, all of those pesky arguments against building a project seem more like excuses, and I find myself spending contemplative time asking constructive questions about the project itself rather than talking myself out of building it.
